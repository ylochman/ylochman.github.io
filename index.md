In Dec 2020 I will start a PhD at Chalmers University of Technology working on the topic of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion. From Feb to Aug 2020 I was a research intern at [Facebook Reality Labs][frl] in Pittsburgh under supervision of [James Pritts](https://prittjam.github.io) and [Michal Perdoch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Y_LBNIAAAAJ). I received my MSc in Jan 2020 at [Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU)][ucu] where I also conducted research in the [Machine Learning Lab][mllab], advised by [James Pritts](https://prittjam.github.io).

My research focuses on robust methods for auto-calibrating cameras with severe lens aberrations. Prior, I developed deep learning models for semantic segmentation, boundary object detection, and studied geometry-aware deep representations for dense feature matching and symmetry detection. Currently, I am very interested in combining geometry and machine learning for 3D vision.
